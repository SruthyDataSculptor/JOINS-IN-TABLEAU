 Joins in Tableau
Joins in Tableau are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a common field. Tableau supports the following types of joins:

Inner Join – Returns only matching records from both tables.
Left Join – Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
Right Join – Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
Full Outer Join – Returns all records from both tables, with NULLs where there is no match.
Key Points:
Joins work best with structured data sources like relational databases.
For large datasets, data blending or relationships might be a better option.
Mismatched joins can lead to data duplication or loss.
